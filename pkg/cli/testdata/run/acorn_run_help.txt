Run an app from an image or Acornfile

Usage:
  run [flags] IMAGE|DIRECTORY [acorn args]

Examples:
# Publish and Expose Port Syntax
  # Publish port 80 for any containers that define it as a port
  acorn run -p 80 .

  # Publish container "myapp" using the hostname app.example.com
  acorn run --publish app.example.com:myapp .

  # Expose port 80 to the rest of the cluster as port 8080
  acorn run --expose 8080:80/http .

# Labels and Annotations Syntax
  # Add a label to all resources created by the app
  acorn run --label key=value .

  # Add a label to resources created for all containers
  acorn run --label containers:key=value .

  # Add a label to the resources created for the volume named "myvolume"
  acorn run --label volumes:myvolume:key=value .

# Link Syntax
  # Link the running acorn application named "mydatabase" into the current app, replacing the container named "db"
  acorn run --link mydatabase:db .

# Secret Syntax
  # Bind the acorn secret named "mycredentials" into the current app, replacing the secret named "creds". See "acorn secrets --help" for more info
  acorn run --secret mycredentials:creds .

# Volume Syntax
  # Create the volume named "mydata" with a size of 5 gigabyes and using the "fast" storage class
  acorn run --volume mydata,size=5G,class=fast .

  # Bind the acorn volume named "mydata" into the current app, replacing the volume named "data", See "acorn volumes --help for more info"
  acorn run --volume mydata:data .

# Automatic upgrades
  # Automatic upgrade for an app will be enabled if '#', '*', or '**' appears in the image's tag. Tags will sorted according to the rules for these special characters described below. The newest tag will be selected for upgrade.

  # '#' denotes a segment of the image tag that should be sorted numerically when finding the newest tag.
  # This example deploys the hello-world app with auto-upgrade enabled and matching all major, minor, and patch versions:
  acorn run myorg/hello-world:v#.#.#

  # '*' denotes a segment of the image tag that should sorted alphabetically when finding the latest tag.
  # In this example, if you had a tag named alpha and a tag named zeta, zeta would be recognized as the newest:
  acorn run myorg/hello-world:*

  # '**' denotes a wildcard. This segment of the image tag won't be considered when sorting. This is useful if your tags have a segment that is unpredictable.
  # This example would sort numerically according to major and minor version (ie v1.2) and ignore anything following the "-":
  acorn run myorg/hello-world:v#.#-**

  # NOTE: Depending on your shell, you may see errors when using '*' and '**'. Using quotes will tell the shell to ignore them so Acorn can parse them:
  acorn run "myorg/hello-world:v#.#-**"

  # Automatic upgrades can be configured explicitly via a flag.
  # In this example, the tag will always be "latest", but acorn will periodically check to see if new content has been pushed to that tag:
  acorn run --auto-upgrade myorg/hello-world:latest

  # To have acorn notify you that an app has an upgrade available and require confirmation before proceeding, set the notify-upgrade flag:
  acorn run --notify-upgrade myorg/hello-world:v#.#.# myapp
  # To proceed with an upgrade you've been notified of:
  acorn update --confirm-upgrade myapp
