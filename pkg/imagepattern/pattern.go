// NewMatcher returns a Regexp that can be used to match an image or image tag against a pattern.
// The supplied pattern is NOT a regex. It is acorn's own custom syntax with the following characteristics:
// - Assumed to be valid docker tag characters: 0-9A-Za-z_.-
// - Outside of the special matching/sorting groups, a tag must match the pattern exactly
// - There are three special matching/sorting groups: #, *, and **
// - ** indicates a portion of the tag doesn't need to match the pattern and won't be considered for sorting. It is the "wildcard"
// - * indicates a portion of the tag that will be matched and sorted alphabetically
// - # indicates a portion of the tag that will be matched and sorted numerically
//
// Here are a few simple examples of patterns and what they would match:
// - "v#.#" - Matches: "v1.0", "v2.0" (return as latest). Doesn't match: "v1.alpha", "1.0", "v1.0.0"
// - "v1.0-*" - Matches: "v1.0-alpha", "v1.0-beta" (returned as latest). Doesn't match: "v1.0"
// - "v1.#-**" - Matches: "v1.0-cv23jkha", "v1.1-2020-01-01" (returned as latest).
