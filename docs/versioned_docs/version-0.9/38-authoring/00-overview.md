title: Overview
---

The primary goal of the Acornfile is to quickly and easily describe how to build, develop, and run containerized applications.

The syntax is very similar to JSON and YAML that you're probably already familiar with from other tools.

The resulting artifact defined by the Acornfile and produced during `acorn build` is a complete package of your application.  It includes all the container images, secrets, data, nested Acorns, etc. in a single OCI image that can be distributed through a registry.

## The primary building blocks

### Objects

In the Acornfile file the primary building block is an object. The generic syntax for any object is:

```acorn
key: {
    // ... fields ...
}
```

They start with a name `key` and wrap a collection of fields and values in `{}`. A more Acorn specific example is:

```acorn
containers: {
    "my-app": {
        // ...
    }
}
```

In the above example, there is an object called `containers`, which contains another object called `my-app`.  Keys do not need to be quoted, unless they contain a `-`.

For convenience, you can collapse objects which have only one field to a single `:` line and omit the braces.  For example these:

```acorn
containers: foo: image: "nginx"

containers: bar: build: {
    context: "."
    target: "static"
}
```

are equivalent to:

```acorn
containers: {
    foo: {
        image: "nginx"
    }
}

containers: {
    bar: {
        build: {
            context: "."
            target: "static"
        }
    }
}
```

### Lists

The other main building block is a list.

```acorn
containers: {
    myapp: {
        // ...
        ports: [
            "80/http",
            "8080/http",
        ]
    }
}
```

Lists are surrounded by `[]`.  Items are separated by a comma.  The last item can include an optional trailing comma.

## Fields

A `field` is a label and a value, we have seen multiple examples of `fields` in the previous examples. Here we will dive deeper.

### Field names

In an Acornfile fields can be strings with [a-zA-Z0-9_] without being wrapped in double quotes. You can use `-`, `/`, and `.` if you use double quotes around the field name.

```acorn
// Valid field names
aLongField: ""
"/a/file/path": ""
"my-application-container": ""
```

### Assigning field values

Variables allow you to store values and later reference them elsewhere in the Acornfile. The syntax for defining a variable is shown below. Values can be a string, number, boolean, list, object, or null.

```acorn
localData: {
    myString: ""
    myInteger: 5
    myBool: true
    myObject: {}
    myList: []
}
```

### Strings

Strings can be a single line or multiline.  A single line string is surrounded by `"` quotes.

Multiline strings are enclosed in triple quotes `"""`. The opening `"""` must be followed by a newline. The closing `"""` must also be on it's own line. The whitespace directly preceding the closing quotes must match the preceding whitespace on all other lines and is not included in the value.  This allows you to indent the text to match current level without the indenting becoming part of the actual value.

```acorn
singleLine: "Hi!"
multiLine: """
    Hello 
    World!
    """
# multiLine is equivalent to "Hello \nWorld!"
```

### Numbers

Numbers are integers by default unless they contain a decimal.

```acorn
int: 4
float: 4.2
```

### Boolean

Booleans are `true` or `false`.

### Null

Null is `null`.

### Comments

You can add comments to document your Acornfile. Comments start with `//` and continue for the rest of the line

```acorn
// This is a comment
some: "value"  // This is a comment about this line
```

### Accessing fields

To reference a variable elsewhere in the file, you separate the key fields of the path by a `.`.

Given these variables:

```acorn
localData: {
    myVariable: ""
    myInteger: 5
    myBool: true
    myObject: {
        aKey: "value"
    }
    "my-app": {
        // ...
    }
}

// Can Be accessed like

v:  localData.myVariable
i:  localData.myInteger
b:  localData.myBool
s:  localData.myObject
s0: localData.myObject.aKey 
s1: localData.myObject["aKey"]
a:  localData."my-app"
```

### Scopes

Fields that reference another field will look for a value starting at the nearest enclosing scope and working upwards until reaching the top-level.

```acorn
port: 3307
containers: app: {
    ports: localData.port // Evaluates to 3306
}
data: port // Evaluates to 3307
localData: {
    port: 3306
    exposedServicePort: port // Evaluates to 3306
}
```

In the above example, `containers.app.ports` would be `3306` along with `localData.exposedServicePort`.

#### Aliases

Because of scoping in the previous example, it would not be possible in the above example to set any value under localData to a value of `port`(3307). One way to address this is to use the `let` operator to alias the port variable.

```acorn
let topLevelPort = port
port: 3307
containers: app: {
    ports: localData.port // Evaluates to 3306
}
data: port // Evaluates to 3307
localData: {
    port: 3306
    exposedServicePort: topLevelPort // Evaluates to 3307
}
```

In the example the top level `port` variable is aliased to `topLevelPort` and assigned to `localData.exposedServicePort`.

### String interpolation

Variables can be inserted into a string by wrapping their name with `\()`.  For example:

```acorn
args: {
    userAdjective: "cool"
}

localData: {
    config: {
        key: "This is something \(args.userAdjective)"
    }
}

# localData.config.key is "This is something cool"
```

Interpolation can also be used for field names:

```acorn
localData: {
    index: 3
}

containers: {
    "my-app-\(localData.index)": {
        // ...
    }
}

# A container named "my-app-3" is being defined
```

### Assigning a variable to another field

Assigning a variable to a field uses the variable accessor.

```acorn
localData: {
    myTokenLength: 64
}

secrets: {
    "my-secret": {
        type: "token"
        params: {
            length: localData.myTokenLength // length is now 64
        }
    }
}
```

### Basic Operators

All the basic math and comparison operators you'd find in a typical programming language are supported:

| Operator | Symbol | Example | Result |
| :--------|:--------|:--------|:-------|
| Addition | `+` | `1 + 1` | `2` |
| Subtraction | `-` | `4 - 1` | `3` |
| Multiplication | `*` | `4 * 2` | `8` |
| Division | `/` | `5 / 2` | `2.5`|
| Greater than | `>` | `2 > 1` | `true` |
| Greater than or equal | `>=` | `2 >= 2` | `true` |
| Less than | `<` | `1 < 1` | `false` |
| Less than or equal | `<=` | `1 <= 1` | `true` |
| Equals | `==` | `1 == 2` | `false` |
| Does not equal | `!=` | `1 != 2` | `true` |
| Not | `!` | `!true` | `false` |
| Or | <code>\|\|</code> | <code>true \|\| false</code> | `true` |
| And | `&&` | `true && false` | `false` |

`-` can also be used to negate a value:

```acorn
a: 42
b: -a // -42
```

Operations can be grouped with parenthesis and combined with `&&` and `||`:

```acorn
a: 5
b: a/(1 + 1) // 2.5
c: (2+2)*4/8 // 2
d: -c * 10 // -20
e: b > c // true
f: e && b > 5 // false
```

### String Operators

Strings can be concatenated, repeated, and compared:

| Operator | Symbol | Example | Result |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:-------|
| Concatenate | `+` | `"hello " + "world"` | `"hello world"` |
| Repeat | `*` | `"hi"*5` | `"hihihihihi"` |
| Greater than | `>` | `"hi" > "bye"` | `true` |
| Greater than or equal | `>=` | `"foo" >= "bar"` | `true` |
| Less than | `<` | `"foo" < "foo` | `false` |
| Less than or equal | `<=` | `"foo" <= "foo"` | `true` |
| Equals | `==` | `"foo" == "bar"` | `false` |
| Does not equal | `!=` | `"foo" != "bar` | `true` |
| Matches regular expression | `=~` | `"hi bob" =~ "^h"` | `true` |
| Does not match regular expression | `!~` | `"hi bob" !~ "^h"` | `false` |

### Regular Expressions

Regular expression syntax is the one accepted by RE2 outlined here [https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax). One exception is `\C` is not accepted.

## Conditionals

### If statements

Support for standard `if` statements is available in an Acornfile. If conditions evaluate to a boolean, and apply their body if the condition is true.

```acorn
localData: {
    scale: 1
}

if localData > 1 {
    // ... Do something
}
```

`if` statements can be added at any level or nested within each other, but there is no `else` in this format.

### If-else expressions

Ternary or "if-else" expressions are available through a built-in function which takes 3 arguments:

```std.ifelse(condition, value-if-true, value-if-false)```

The following example will publish either port 3000 or 80 depending on `args.dev`:

```acorn
containers: {
    app: {
        ports: publish: std.ifelse(args.dev, "3000/http", "80/http")
    }
}
```

See the [function library](../reference/functions#ifelse) for more information.

## For loops

The Acornfile syntax provides a for loop construct to iterate through objects and lists.

```acorn
for i in std.range(0, 10) {
    containers: {
        "my-instance-\(i)": {
            // ...
        }
    }
}
```

### Object field comprehensions

```acorn
localData:{
    dataVols: {
        dbData: "/var/lib/mysql"
        backups: "/backups"
    }
}

for k, v in localData.dataVols { 
    volumes: {
       "\(k)": {}
    }
    containers: {
       // ...
        dirs: {
          "\(v)": "volumes://\(k)"
        }
       // ...
    }
}
```

### List comprehensions

Acornfile

```acorn
localData: {
    list: ["one", "two", "three"]
}

localData: {
    multiLineContent: std.join([for i in localData.list {"Item: \(i)"}], "\n")
}
```

Renders to:

```acorn
localData: {
 list: ["one", "two", "three"]
 multiLineContent: """
  Item: one
  Item: two
  Item: three
  """
}
```

## Function Library

Acorn includes a built-in library of functions to perform common operations.  See the [function library](../reference/functions) for more information.
